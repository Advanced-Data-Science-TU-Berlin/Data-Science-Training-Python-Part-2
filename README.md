## Prequisite knowledge
For this training, we assume a basic knowledge of Python ecosystem used for data science. Basic knowledge of:
- python moduled such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. 
- Jupyter notebook
- data visualization

## Acknowledgments
This repository would not exist without the work of many great minds. In particular we would like to acknowledge `Kaggle` for being awesome with their contests and varied data sets
