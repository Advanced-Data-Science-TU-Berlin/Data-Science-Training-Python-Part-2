This dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network). It contains 40,616 characters and 65,870 relationships connecting them. We will be using this dataset to discover its hidden characteristics, how the different characters influenced each other and their communities structure.\n",

For example, every time Spider Man appears in a comic book with Captain America, we will have a line with both their names. Additionally, the characters have numerous properties that can be associated with each node.\n",

        "- nodes.csv: Contains two columns (node, type), indicating the name and the type (comic, hero) of the nodes.\n",
