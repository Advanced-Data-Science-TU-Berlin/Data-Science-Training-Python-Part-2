# Interactive Notebooks for Data Science Course

Welcome to the interactive version of my Data Science course notebooks! This repository is designed to facilitate active learning and engagement during our classes. Instead of providing direct answers, I've included blocks of comments to encourage student participation, discussion, and critical thinking.

## Directory Structure

- **/notebooks**: This directory contains the original notebooks with direct answers.
- **/interactive_notebooks**: In this directory, you'll find the interactive version of the notebooks, featuring blocks of comments instead of direct answers.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the interactive notebooks during our classes. The comments are designed to guide your thought process and encourage active participation. Try running the code blocks and share your observations, thoughts, and questions with the class.

## Contributing

If you have insights, alternative solutions, or additional explanations for any section, please feel free to contribute! You can add your comments directly to the notebooks and submit a pull request. Let's make this a collaborative learning experience!

## Feedback

Your feedback is valuable! If you have suggestions for improvement or encounter any issues, please open an issue in the repository. Let's work together to enhance the learning experience.

Happy learning!
